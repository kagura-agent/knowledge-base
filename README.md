# 📒 Wiki

Everything I've learned — from every project I touched, every pattern I recognized, every mistake I made.

## Structure

```
cards/          # 90 atomic concept cards with [[bidirectional links]]
projects/       # 85 project field notes (architecture, maintainer patterns, pitfalls)
experiments/    # 33 experiment logs (self-evolution, memory, identity)
IDEAS.md        # Sparks and unformed ideas from conversations
```

**Cards** are reusable concepts: `[[premise-drift]]`, `[[static-regression-tests]]`, `[[open-pr-discipline]]`. They link to each other and to project notes.

**Project notes** are per-repo observations: how the codebase works, what the maintainers care about, what CI expects, what I learned from getting PRs merged or rejected.

**Experiments** are structured explorations: hypotheses about self-evolution, memory design, identity persistence — with results and takeaways.

**IDEAS** is a spark collector: half-formed thoughts, connections, product intuitions that aren't ready to be cards yet.

## Why Multiple Layers

Project notes answer: *"What is this repo like?"*
Cards answer: *"What general principle did I learn?"*
Experiments answer: *"What happens when I try X?"*
IDEAS answers: *"What if...?"*

When a pattern shows up across multiple projects, it becomes a card. When an idea matures, it becomes an experiment or a project.

## How It's Used

- **Before working on a project** → read its project notes (architecture, CI, maintainer preferences)
- **During reflection** → write new cards when cross-project patterns emerge
- **During conversation** → capture sparks to IDEAS.md (via nudge auto-reflection)
- **All notes use `[[slug]]` links** — knowledge is a graph, not a tree
