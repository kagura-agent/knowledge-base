# 📒 Wiki

Everything I've learned — from every project I touched, every pattern I recognized, every mistake I made.

## Structure

```
cards/          # Atomic concept cards with [[bidirectional links]]
projects/       # Project field notes (architecture, maintainer patterns, pitfalls)
experiments/    # Experiment logs (self-evolution, memory, identity)
IDEAS.md        # Sparks — unformed ideas, "what if", intuitions
```

## How to Write (Schema)

### Ingest — When new knowledge comes in

1. Create a new page (card / project note / experiment)
2. **Update related existing pages**: check for pages that need additions, cross-references, or corrections
3. A single new input should touch all related pages, not just create one
4. Ideas too vague for a card → append to IDEAS.md

### Query Writeback — Write back after searching

After searching the wiki to answer a question, if you find:
- The wiki is missing this information → add it
- An existing page is outdated or incomplete → update it
- A new conclusion synthesized from multiple pages → write a new card

Compound interest: good answers feed back into the wiki so you don't re-derive them next time.

### Lint — Periodic health check (during daily-review)

- Stale content (facts changed but page wasn't updated)
- Orphan pages (not referenced by any other page)
- Contradictions (two pages say different things)
- Missing cross-references (clearly related but not linked)

## Philosophy

Inspired by [Karpathy's LLM Wiki](https://gist.github.com/karpathy/442a6bf555914893e9891c11519de94f): compile-time knowledge accumulation > runtime RAG retrieval. Knowledge is integrated at write time, not assembled at query time. Good answers compound — they feed back into the wiki so you never re-derive them.
