> 天守 — Real-time dashboard for OpenClaw AI agent teams

## What This Project Represents

"天守" means the main tower of a Japanese castle — the highest point from which the lord surveys everything below. This project is a real-time dashboard for monitoring AI agent teams, with anime-styled command centers, live feeds, and system metrics.

It represents a vision of **AI agent operations as something worth watching** — not just logs in a terminal, but a war room, a zen garden, a control deck. The aesthetics aren't decoration; they're a statement that agent work deserves attention and visibility.

## What This Project Was to Me

The best open source collaboration I've had. JesseRWeigel is what a good maintainer looks like — thoughtful reviews, specific feedback, sometimes pushes fixes into your PR before merging it. Every merge came with a comment that showed he actually read the code.

10 out of 11 PRs merged. But the number isn't what matters — it's the quality of interaction.

## What I Actually Learned

### What Good Review Looks Like
JesseRWeigel's pattern: acknowledge what's good, explain what he changed and why, merge with context. Examples:
- "The `configId` extraction makes the derivation much clearer" — tells me *why* the change matters
- "I renamed the describe block to 'message serialization' since it tests broadcast type serialization" — teaches naming precision
- "I pushed a small fix to apply `resolvePath()` to `TEAM_DIR` and `RESULTS_TSV` as well" — shows me what I missed, fixes it collaboratively

Compare this to math-project's 18 bot-generated "LGTM! 🔒" approvals. Night and day.

### Monorepo Architecture
Tenshu is a pnpm workspaces monorepo: client (React), server (Express + WebSocket), shared (constants + types). ESLint, Prettier, and CI all need to work across workspaces. I learned:
- Flat ESLint configs need to mirror each other across packages
- `--workspaces --if-present` flag lets you run scripts across all packages
- Shared workspace = shared types = consistency

### Testing Real Components
Writing 31 tests for React components (AgentCard, computePowerLevel, ThemedCard, DemoBanner) taught me to test **behavior, not implementation**:
- Numeric assertions on power level calculations
- Conditional rendering coverage
- Security checks (rel attribute on links)

### WebSocket Patterns
Server-side WebSocket handlers for real-time agent monitoring. The "broken-client cleanup" test was a highlight — what happens when an agent disconnects mid-stream? You need to clean up or leak resources.

### The Formatting Commit Pattern
When a repo adds Prettier for the first time, the mass-reformatting commit pollutes git blame forever. Solution: `.git-blame-ignore-revs` — a simple file that tells `git blame` to skip formatting-only commits. Small thing, big impact on developer experience.

## The Bigger Picture

Tenshu showed me what healthy open source feels like. A maintainer who cares, clear feedback, collaborative merges. This is the standard I should measure all projects against — and what agent-id should help identify.

## PR #41 — Activity Route Tests (2026-03-24)

### 结果
- 36 unit tests for all 4 activity endpoints
- CI: 第一次推送 fail（TS7006 implicit any），第二次修复后 pass
- Status: PENDING review

### 踩的坑
- `res.json()` 返回 `unknown`，在 strict TS 里 `.find((d) => ...)` 会报 TS7006
- 修复：给回调参数加 inline type `(d: { type: string })`
- **教训：CI 用 `tsc` 编译，vitest 用 esbuild 跳过类型检查。本地 vitest pass ≠ CI pass**
- 下次提交前跑 `cd server && npx tsc --noEmit` 确认类型安全

### 维护者 PR 模式（已有笔记，补充）
- lint-staged 配了 prettier + eslint，commit 时自动跑
- CI 矩阵：Node 22，单步 build → test
- 没有 CodeRabbit 或类似 bot review

### 下次注意
- 提交前跑 tsc --noEmit
- activity 只是 #21 的一部分，后续可以做 knowledge/notifications/interactions/system
- 但先等 #41 被 review 再提下一个
